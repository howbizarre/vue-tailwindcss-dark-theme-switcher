# Dark Theme Switcher with Vue 3 and Tailwindcss

Very basic and simple **dark theme switcher** using some plain Javascript, Vue 3 and Tailwindcss.

## In 4 simple steps

1. Install Vue 3

Just follow the instruction from Vue's official documentation - [Creating a Vue Application](https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html#creating-a-vue-application).

2. Add Tailwindcss

Use official documentation on the Tailwindcss website but start from point 2 (Install Tailwind CSS) - [Install Tailwind CSS with Vite Using Vue](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite#vue).

3. Add theme switcher

I will add it to the index.html file to visualize its usage. I leave it to you to find the most convenient way to use it in your project.

4. Add test content

I have added the contents of the App.vue to test the functionality.
