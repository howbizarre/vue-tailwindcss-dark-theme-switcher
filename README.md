# Dark Theme Switcher with Vue 3 and Tailwindcss

Very basic and simple dark theme switcher using Vue 3 and Tailwindcss

## In 4 simple steps

1. Install Vue 3

Just follow the instruction from Vue's official documentation - [Creating a Vue Application](https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html#creating-a-vue-application)

2. Add Tailwindcss to the project

Use official documentation on the Tailwindcss website but start from point 2 (Install Tailwind CSS) - [Install Tailwind CSS with Vite Using Vue](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite#vue)

3. Add a Theme Switcher

I will add it to the index.html file to visualize its usage. I leave it to you to find the most convenient way to use it in your project.
